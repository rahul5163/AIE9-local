    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

      "Assistant: Hi Sarah! It's great that you're looking to improve your sleep and reduce stress through exercise. Given your bad knee, we want to focus on low-impact activities that are gentle on your joints. Here are some exercises you might enjoy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Walking**: A simple and effective way to get moving. Try to walk in the morning when you feel fresh. You can start with short distances and gradually increase as you feel comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Swimming**: This is a fantastic low-impact workout that can help you relax and improve your overall fitness without putting stress on your knee.\n",

      "3. **Yoga**: Gentle yoga can be excellent for reducing stress and improving flexibility. Look for classes that focus on restorative or gentle yoga, which can also help with sleep.\n",

      "4. **Cycling**: If you have access to a stationary bike or can ride a bike on flat surfaces, this can be a great way to get your heart rate up without straining your knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pilates**: This can help strengthen your core and improve your flexibility, which may also support your knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you prefer to work out in the morning and have availability on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, you could create a routine that incorporates these activities. For example, you might walk on Mondays, do yoga on Wednesdays, and swim on Fridays. \n",

      "3. **Elliptical (if tolerated)**  \n",

    "2. Uses semantic memory to find relevant advice\n",

      "2. **Keep movement regular but manageable:** follow a beginner-friendly pattern like **20-minute walks + 10 minutes stretching** twice this week, plus **one short bodyweight session** (15 minutes).\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
