Regular physical activity can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.\\n\\nThe four main types of exercise are aerobic (cardio), strength training, flexibility, and balance exercises. A well-rounded fitness routine includes all four types. Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days per week.\\n\\nChapter 2: Exercises for Common Problems\\n\\nLower Back Pain Relief\\nLower back pain affects approximately 80% of adults at some point in their lives.

Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can help alleviate discomfort and prevent future episodes.\\n\\nRecommended exercises for lower back pain include:\\n- Cat-Cow Stretch: Start on hands and knees, alternate between arching your back up (cat) and letting it sag down (cow). Do 10-15 repetitions.\\n- Bird Dog: From hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg while keeping your core engaged. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Do 10 repetitions per side.\\n- Partial Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over chest, tighten stomach muscles and raise shoulders off floor. Hold briefly, then lower. Do 8-12 repetitions.\\n- Knee-to-Chest Stretch: Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\\n- Pelvic Tilts: Lie on your back with knees bent, flatten your back against the floor by tightening abs and tilting p',\n",

Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\\n- Pelvic Tilts: Lie on your back with knees bent, flatten your back against the floor by tightening abs and tilting pelvis up slightly. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 8-12 times.\\n\\nNeck and Shoulder Tension\\nDesk work and poor posture often lead to neck and shoulder tension. These exercises can provide relief:\\n- Neck Rolls: Slowly roll your head in a circle, 5 times in each direction.\\n- Shoulder Shrugs: Raise shoulders toward ears, hold for 5 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times.\\n- Chest Opener: Clasp hands behind back, squeeze shoulder blades together, and lift arms slightly. Hold for 15-30 seconds.\\n- Chin Tucks: While sitting or standing tall, pull your chin back to create a \"double chin.\" Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times.\\n\\nChapter 3: Building a Workout Routine\\n\\nStarting a new exercise routine can feel overwhelming.

    "1. Yes. Per API documentation, we can update model to accept dimension as input. I have added necessary code. Please review. I noticed that text-embedding-3-small supports only upto 1536 dimensions. So I was able to test with smaller dimensions. Higher than 1536 threw error.\n",
    "2. OPENAI uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to achieve this. When we request a smaller dimension, the model generates the full embedding and returns only the specified number of dimensions. Smaller dimensions comes handy when we have speed/storage constraints. "

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
