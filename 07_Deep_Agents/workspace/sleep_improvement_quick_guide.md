- Practice 4-7-8 breathing or progressive muscle relaxation
- Write down worries to address tomorrow

**Waking up tired?**
- Check sleep duration (aim for 7-9 hours)
- Assess sleep environment (too hot, noisy, bright?)
- Consider if you're waking during deep sleep phases

**Weekend sleep-in urges?**
- Limit to 1 extra hour maximum
- Use bright light immediately upon waking
- Plan engaging morning activities

**Caffeine cravings?**
- Gradually reduce intake over 1-2 weeks
- Switch to decaf or herbal teas in afternoon
- Increase morning light exposure for natural alertness

Remember: Consistency is more important than perfection. Focus on implementing one change at a time and building sustainable habits gradually.
