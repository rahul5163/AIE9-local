## Wellness Interconnections

The assessment reveals a strong interconnected pattern:
- **Poor Sleep** → Increased cortisol → Weight retention → Low energy
- **Sedentary Work** → Poor posture → Back pain → Sleep disruption
- **Weight Goals** → Exercise needs → Better sleep → More energy → Easier weight management

This creates an opportunity for positive cascading effects when addressed systematically.

## Risk Factors to Monitor

1. **Metabolic Slowdown:** Extended sitting can reduce metabolic rate
